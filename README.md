# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer (C++)

This project is a simple console-based application written in **C++** that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work.  
It generates a random array based on user input and allows the user to choose which algorithm to use for sorting.  
The program then shows the sorted output step by step in the terminal, making it easier to understand how each algorithm functions.

---

## Features
- User can input the size of the array.
- Random array generation for testing.
- Choice between multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- Step-by-step visualization in the terminal.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** programming language  
- Standard Libraries:
  - `<iostream>` → for input/output  
  - `<vector>` → to store dynamic arrays  
  - `<cstdlib>` → for generating random numbers  
  - `<ctime>` → to seed the random number generator  
  - `<chrono>` & `<thread>` → for adding delays in visualization
